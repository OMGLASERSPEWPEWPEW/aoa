**assistant**: Deployed successfully. Live at **https://aoa-nine.vercel.app**.

Now — about your question on map-independence. The analysis showed **10 of 13 MVP features work without Mapbox**, and the MapView already has a graceful "Map Coming Soon" fallback. The key gap is there's no way to discover events/venues without the map — no list or search view.

The natural next move for Phase 4 is to build the map-independent features first:

**assistant**: **Phase 4: Content + Social** — all the map-independent features that make the app actually useful without a Mapbox token. The DB schemas are already built, so this is all UI + seed data.

Here's the natural order:

|---|---------|-----------------|--------|

## 2026-07-30_19-18-03 (session 7b5cd3ab)

**assistant**: Here's the honest status:

**Testing: Nothing.** Zero testing infrastructure. No Vitest, no Playwright, no test config, no test files, no `test` script in package.json. We're flying without a net.

**OAuth: Not implemented.** Auth is email/password only — `signInWithPassword` and `signUp`. No Google, GitHub, or any social login. The Login page has no OAuth buttons, and AuthContext has no `signInWithOAuth` method.

Both are gaps we should address before building more features. Here's my recommend...

## 2026-07-30_19-29-14 (session 7b5cd3ab)

**assistant**: 24 tests pass but there are 2 unhandled rejections — the mock's `signInWithPassword` and `signUp` return `{ data: {}, error: null }` but the AuthContext destructures `{ error }` from the result. The mock needs to return the right shape. Let me fix it.

**assistant**: [tool: Edit]

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: **24 tests, 5 files, all passing, zero errors.** Now let's run Playwright.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

2. **Mobile blank page** — open https://aoa-nine.vercel.app on your phone again. The new service worker with `skipWaiting + clientsClaim` should force-replace the cached broken build. If it's still blank, clear site data in your phone's browser settings for that domain.

## 2026-07-31_11-13-32 (session 7b5cd3ab)

**assistant**: Great, glad both are working! Here's what's still on your plate (manual steps I can't do):

1. **Mapbox token** — get one from [mapbox.com](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/), then:
   - Add to `.env.local`: `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.xxx`
   - Add to Vercel: `vercel env add VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN production`
   - This unlocks the Map tab, venue markers, and class markers

**user**: 2. Supabase MCP personal access token — lets me query your DB directly from here. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens →
  generate a token. Then update .mcp.json with it.

Do you need this even with CLI access?

---

## 2026-07-31_11-15-40 (session 7b5cd3ab)

**assistant**: No — I have full CLI access via `supabase db push`, `supabase functions deploy`, and direct SQL through `supabase db reset` / migrations. The MCP server is a nice-to-have for live querying (like "show me all rows in profiles"), but it's not blocking anything.

Skip it. The only real blocker is the Mapbox token.

## 2026-08-02_14-28-16 (session 7b5cd3ab)

**assistant**: You're right, I may have triggered a Node version change at some point. I'm currently in plan mode so I can't run commands — but you can run this directly:

```
! nvm install 22 && nvm alias default 22
```

Type that in the prompt here (the `!` prefix runs it in this session). That'll pin Node 22 as your default so it doesn't happen again.

Alternatively, if you want me to handle it, exit plan mode and I'll fix it and then come back to the iterate items.

**user**: now what? it still doesnt work

**assistant**: Claude Code was installed under Node 23, so the binary is linked to that version. You need to reinstall it under Node 22. Run these:

```
! node --version
```

To confirm you're on 22, then:

```
! npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

That'll reinstall the CLI under Node 22's module path. Should fix it in other terminals too.

## 2026-08-02_14-30-20 (session 7b5cd3ab)

**assistant**: You're on Node 22 now. Reinstall Claude Code under this version:

```
! npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

That should fix the `.exe` extension error in your other terminals.

**assistant**: [tool: WebSearch]

**assistant**: Found it — it's a **known bug** ([#57178](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/57178)). The auto-updater creates a broken `claude.exe` symlink on macOS. Not your fault, not mine — it's an upstream Claude Code bug.

Try this fix:

```

```

That'll show what's in the bin directory. The `.exe` file shouldn't be the entrypoint on ...

---

## 2026-08-02_14-35-02 (session 7b5cd3ab)

**assistant**: The npm package ships `claude.exe` as a compiled binary — it's not a Windows thing, it's a standalone executable that macOS should run directly. The problem is the symlink is going through Node instead of executing it directly. Try this:

```
! which claude && file $(which claude)
```

This will show us if the symlink is pointing through Node (a shell script wrapper) or directly at the binary. 

If that doesn't help, the [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshoot-install) recom...

**assistant**: So the binary itself is correct (Mach-O arm64), but it internally spawns Node which tries to load `claude.exe` as an ESM module. This is a Claude Code packaging bug, not something you caused.

Since this session IS working fine, the issue is only in new terminals. Try the native installer which bypasses npm entirely:

```
! curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | sh
```

Then in your other terminal, use `~/.local/bin/claude` instead. You may also want to remove the broken npm one after:

## 2026-08-02_14-39-08 (session 7b5cd3ab)

**assistant**: Found it. The session logs show this session started on **version 2.1.144** — that's what was working. Claude Code **auto-updated itself** to 2.1.220, and the newer version has the broken `.exe` binary issue.

You weren't wrong — I didn't change it either. Claude Code auto-updates in the background.

To revert to the working version:

```
! npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.144

That'll pin you back to the version that's running right now (this session is 2.1.144). You can also di...

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: Found the issue. The Supabase client has no explicit auth persistence config, and the `onAuthStateChange` doesn't differentiate between events. If a token refresh fails (common after closing a PWA on mobile), the user gets silently signed out. Let me fix this.

**assistant**: [tool: Edit]

**assistant**: Now fix the AuthContext to handle token refresh failures gracefully — if a refresh fails, retry before giving up, and log events so we can diagnose further.

**assistant**: **v0.4.23 deployed.** Three changes to fix session persistence:

1. **Explicit auth config** — `persistSession: true`, `autoRefreshToken: true`, and `flowType: 'pkce'`. These were implicit defaults before, but the PKCE flow is more robust for PWAs than the default implicit flow because it handles token exchange more reliably after the app has been closed and reopened.

2. **Mounted guard** — prevents stale async callbacks from updating auth state after the component unmounts (a race condition du...

**assistant**: Everything from v0.4.24 is already pushed — `origin/main..HEAD` is empty.

The remaining changes are all `.claude/` journals/memory files (agent infra), a design zip, a design folder, and the pitch deck HTML source. None of these are feature code — they're session artifacts and design assets.

Nothing to commit for the username login feature — it's fully shipped. Want me to commit any of these leftover files (journals, design assets), or leave them for now?

## 2026-08-08_11-25-15 (session b9154454)

**assistant**: Yes — the Chrome DevTools MCP connects to a headless Chrome instance. That's why the form fill keeps failing — HMR reloads are invalidating the element UIDs between the snapshot and the fill action.

I can work around it with `evaluate_script` (which runs JS directly and doesn't depend on UIDs), or you can test the theme toggle yourself in your browser since the dev server is running on `localhost:5204`. Navigate to Settings after logging in — you'll see the new Light / Dark / System buttons.

Did you do that? Like it created a window.  is our project / claude md memory or whatever setup with instructions to only use headless browsers and not create a chrome window? It interferes with my use of the macbook

**assistant**: You're right, I apologize — the Chrome DevTools MCP opened a real Chrome window on your screen. That's disruptive. Let me check how it's configured.

## 2026-08-08_11-41-59 (session b9154454)

**assistant**: Sorry! The `--headless` config change won't take effect until the MCP server restarts, which happens when you start a new Claude Code session. The current session is still using the old non-headless config.

I'll stop using Chrome DevTools for the rest of this session. You can test the theme toggle yourself:

1. Go to `localhost:5204` in your browser
2. Log in
3. Navigate to Settings (via the profile/you tab → settings)
4. You'll see the **Appearance** section with Light / Dark / System buttons
