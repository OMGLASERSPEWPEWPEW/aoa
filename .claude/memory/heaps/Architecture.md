Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   Deric is building "The Art of Art" (AOA) — a map-centric PWA that guides newcomers into the Chicago theater scene through an AI mentor, martial-arts-belt progression, Goodreads-style tracking, and community reviews.

**assistant**: Deployed successfully. Live at **https://aoa-nine.vercel.app**.

Now — about your question on map-independence. The analysis showed **10 of 13 MVP features work without Mapbox**, and the MapView already has a graceful "Map Coming Soon" fallback. The key gap is there's no way to discover events/venues without the map — no list or search view.

The natural next move for Phase 4 is to build the map-independent features first:

1. **Event/venue list view** — browsable feed so users can discover cont...

**user**: Here is the current SOTA ecosystem for tracking Claude Code usage:
1. Terminal Hooks & Node Interceptors
If you want absolute precision, you have to bypass the text transcripts and track the actual API requests.
cccost (by badlogic): This is highly regarded for accuracy. Instead of running Claude Code directly, you run your session via cccost. It hooks into the NodeJS fetch() function and intercepts all API requests to Anthropic's servers. It tracks true cache reads/writes and costs, avoiding kn...

## 2026-07-30_19-18-03 (session 7b5cd3ab)

**assistant**: Here's the honest status:

**Testing: Nothing.** Zero testing infrastructure. No Vitest, no Playwright, no test config, no test files, no `test` script in package.json. We're flying without a net.

**OAuth: Not implemented.** Auth is email/password only — `signInWithPassword` and `signUp`. No Google, GitHub, or any social login. The Login page has no OAuth buttons, and AuthContext has no `signInWithOAuth` method.

Both are gaps we should address before building more features. Here's my recommend...

## 2026-07-30_19-29-14 (session 7b5cd3ab)

**assistant**: 24 tests pass but there are 2 unhandled rejections — the mock's `signInWithPassword` and `signUp` return `{ data: {}, error: null }` but the AuthContext destructures `{ error }` from the result. The mock needs to return the right shape. Let me fix it.

**assistant**: [tool: Edit]

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: **24 tests, 5 files, all passing, zero errors.** Now let's run Playwright.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: The short password test fails because the HTML `minLength={8}` attribute triggers browser-native validation (tooltip), preventing the form from submitting to the JS handler. Let me fix the test to match actual behavior.

2. **Mobile blank page** — open https://aoa-nine.vercel.app on your phone again. The new service worker with `skipWaiting + clientsClaim` should force-replace the cached broken build. If it's still blank, clear site data in your phone's browser settings for that domain.

**assistant**: Great, glad both are working! Here's what's still on your plate (manual steps I can't do):

1. **Mapbox token** — get one from [mapbox.com](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/), then:
   - Add to `.env.local`: `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.xxx`
   - Add to Vercel: `vercel env add VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN production`

**assistant**: Deployed as v0.4.11. The changelog dropdown is now fixed-positioned (`left: 10, right: 10, z-index: 200`) so it won't clip on mobile.

Now addressing your follow-up — let me check the profile page (You page) and map colors.

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: The fix is in place (line 14: `setLoading(false)` when user is null). But there's a subtle issue — on line 23, `useEmotionAggregates('season')` is called **after** the loading check in Profile.tsx. The hook is called unconditionally on every render, which is correct for React rules, but the problem is that the Profile component might be hitting a different issue on PWA.

Let me check the actual behavior — when loading is true, Profile shows "Loading..." — but there could be an issue with the hoo...

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: The map color code is there. Both of these issues are likely the PWA serving cached v0.4.7. Force-refreshing or clearing the service worker cache should pick up v0.4.11.

The service worker update behavior might be the real problem — if the SW is caching aggressively and not picking up new versions. Let me check the PWA config.

**assistant**: The map colors only apply to `relationship === 'seen'` markers. So they'd only show if the user has logged shows as seen. The design spec's "color coding" might also refer to the general venue type coloring from the design spec — let me check what it says.

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: That doc still says `status: pending` but the README says complete. The code IS wired up — `dominantColor` is populated from watchlist emotions. The map colors will only appear for venues where you've logged a show as "seen" with emotions selected. If you haven't done that yet, all markers show the default grey.

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: The `Venue` type already has `photo_url` and `website_url` — no changes needed to the frontend types. The new columns (`photo_url_source`, `website_url_checked_at`) are only used by the scraper, not the frontend.

Let me check if the scraper has finished.

**assistant**: Still running — it needs to fetch 37 venue homepages plus scrape events. Let me wait a bit longer and check.

Everything is deployed and working:

**Deployed v0.4.18** — two new features added to the event scraper:

```

Type that in the prompt here (the `!` prefix runs it in this session). That'll pin Node 22 as your default so it doesn't happen again.

Alternatively, if you want me to handle it, exit plan mode and I'll fix it and then come back to the iterate items.

**assistant**: Claude Code was installed under Node 23, so the binary is linked to that version. You need to reinstall it under Node 22. Run these:

```
! node --version
```

To confirm you're on 22, then:

```
! npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

That'll reinstall the CLI under Node 22's module path. Should fix it in other terminals too.

**assistant**: The npm package ships `claude.exe` as a compiled binary — it's not a Windows thing, it's a standalone executable that macOS should run directly. The problem is the symlink is going through Node instead of executing it directly. Try this:

```
! which claude && file $(which claude)
```

This will show us if the symlink is pointing through Node (a shell script wrapper) or directly at the binary. 

If that doesn't help, the [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshoot-install) recom...

**assistant**: So the binary itself is correct (Mach-O arm64), but it internally spawns Node which tries to load `claude.exe` as an ESM module. This is a Claude Code packaging bug, not something you caused.

Since this session IS working fine, the issue is only in new terminals. Try the native installer which bypasses npm entirely:

```
! curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | sh
```

Then in your other terminal, use `~/.local/bin/claude` instead. You may also want to remove the broken npm one after:

You weren't wrong — I didn't change it either. Claude Code auto-updates in the background.

To revert to the working version:

**assistant**: Add an alias to your shell. Done in 2 seconds:

```
! echo 'alias claude="/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/bin/claude.exe"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

Then `claude` will work in every new terminal. No symlinks, no npm, no Node — just runs the binary directly.

**user**: that didn't work but maybe this is a clue:

i opened up terminal and claude works there but not in ghostty

**assistant**: That's the clue — it's a **Ghostty-specific shell config issue**. Ghostty likely doesn't source `~/.zshrc` the same way Terminal.app does, or it uses a different shell initialization path.

Check what Ghostty's shell config does:

```
! cat ~/.config/ghostty/config 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

And also check if the alias landed in the right file:

```
! grep claude ~/.zshrc ~/.zprofile ~/.zshenv 2>/dev/null
```

Ghostty might source `~/.zshenv` or `~/.zprofile` instead of `~/.zshrc`. If so, move ...

**assistant**: I can't make edits in plan mode. Run this yourself:

```
! sed -i '' '/cccost/d' ~/.zshrc && sed -i '' '/claude.exe/d' ~/.zshrc
```

That removes both the `cccost` alias line and the `.exe` alias we added. Then `claude` will resolve to the binary in PATH directly.

Then test in Ghostty:

claude --version

If it starts with `#!/usr/bin/env node`, that's the problem — npm is routing the binary through Node's module loader. We'd replace it with a direct exec:

```

**user**: would the theater industry or union allow an app that allows people to tip actors after a play? but also there are non union productions... would they or could they stop? Legalities and stuff?

**assistant**: Great question for AoA's direction. Short answer: **nobody could legally stop you from building it**, but the landscape is nuanced.

**Equity (AEA) side:** Equity contracts set minimum pay, but they don't prohibit actors from receiving gifts or gratuities. The concern would be if tips *replaced* fair wages or if producers used tipping to justify lower guarantees. Equity would likely push back on anything that looked like "tip your actor instead of us paying them." But a tip *on top of* contracte...

Do you understand what I am asking? I see a lot of posts showing code like that. Can you web search? It's something that should be observable by others

**assistant**: Yes — a live dashboard that visualizes the graph engineering execution in real-time: which nodes are done, which loops are running, iteration counts, agent assignments, and progress as features get built. Like a CI/CD pipeline view but for AI agent workflows.

Let me search for what's out there first.

When you run `/new-feature` for "top nav bar" or anything else, it'll create the graph file. Lighthouse picks it up. You see the feature's nodes light up as you build.

# New Feature Documentation Workflow

You are executing the **new feature documentation workflow**. This skill produces complete, implementation-ready documentation — NOT code.

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: The component uses `var(--access)` for the ushered color, but the test expects the raw `oklch(0.68 0.13 150)` value. CSS variables don't resolve in jsdom (the test environment). The test selector will never match.

**assistant**: [tool: Edit]

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: All 4 tests pass. The test was checking for a raw `oklch()` color value but the component uses a CSS variable `var(--access)` — jsdom doesn't resolve CSS variables so the selector never matched. Fixed to match the actual inline style.

**user**: I'm running the scrapper but its stuck on 0 scraped 0 events found

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: The batch returned 200 in 4.8 seconds with no errors. The issue is likely that all venues were scraped within the last 24 hours — the `scraped_at` filter skips them. Let me check.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: Found it. The `event-scrape-batch` function is calling the OLD `event-scraper` — which runs the enrichment phase first (all 135 venue photo checks) before doing any event scraping. The batch function imports `processVenue` from event-scraper, but the event-scraper itself runs the full NDJSON flow including enrichment when called directly.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: It works. `{"scraped":3,"events_found":6,"events_created":6,"remaining":108}` — the two-pass pipeline processed 3 venues, found 6 events, created all 6, and 108 venues remain.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

---

## 2026-08-11_11-45-58 (session 66f33189)

**assistant**: Fixed and deployed. The bug was that importing `processVenue` from `event-scraper/index.ts` executed the `serve()` call in that file — Deno runs top-level code on import. Moved `processVenue` and all its helpers to `_shared/scraper/process-venue.ts` (no `serve()` call).

Verified working: `{"scraped":3,"events_found":6,"events_created":6,"remaining":108}` — the two-pass pipeline is running. Hit "Run Scraper" now and you'll see it process 3 venues at a time with real progress.

## 2026-08-12_19-12-29 (session ddbeaf17)

**assistant**: Here's where we stand at **v0.12.0**:

**Done (this session):**
- N00-N02: Emotion light-theme helpers + EmotionDots component
- N03-N06: All schema migrations + TypeScript types (play_interest, artists, credits, plans, threads, notifications, calls, standing_calls, learn_cards)
- N09: Nav restructured to TONIGHT / CALLBOARD / [star] / LOBBY / YOU
- N10/N12: Tonight + ProductionDetail verified, belt references cleaned
- N13: Discover rewritten with spec filter chips + work-level play cards
- N14...

**user**: wait this isn't good we wiped a lot of stuff that was good. Revert.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: Reverting both commits to get back to `f123e78` (v0.11.1). This keeps all your prior work intact.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: Both deployed. Now let me test the TIC cross-reference to see if it finds more matches.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: Major improvement:

- **TIC shows found: 113** (up from 17 — pagination fix worked!)
- **Enriched: 29 events** (up from 7 — company-split + more shows to match)
- **Cached matches: 21** (known-pair cache is working)
- **AI matches: 0** (the ambiguous pairs might not have triggered, or the AI call didn't fire — let me check)

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: **Results:**
- **NULL dates: 168** (down from 197 — 29 events got dates from TIC)
- **match_decisions table: 33 entries** (19 matched, 14 rejected — all logged for training)
- **TIC shows: 113** (pagination fix captured the full catalog)

Let me run it a second time to verify the known-pair cache works.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: Known-pair cache working — 9 cached matches (skipped heuristic + AI). Enriched 0 because the 29 events from the first run already got their dates.

Now commit, push, deploy frontend.

**assistant**: Now build, deploy, test.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: Let me test the TIC cross-reference to see if it now finds more events by fetching detail pages.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: **46 events enriched** (up from 29). The detail page fetching added 17 more events that were previously dropped. Let me check the NULL date count now.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: NULL dates down to **151** (from 189 → 38 more events got dates from TIC detail pages). But Abuela's Follies still isn't in the DB — `tic-crossref` only enriches *existing* events, it doesn't create new ones. Abuela's was never scraped from Red Orchid's website.

The strategy agent WILL add it as a TIC-only event when the scraper runs on Red Orchid — it'll find it via TIC, see it's not in the venue's events, fetch the detail page for dates, and add it with `found_by: ["tic"]`. You just need to r...

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: Shipped. Here's the progress on the data:

| Metric | v1 (Aug 11) | v2 first run | After TIC fix | Now |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-----|
| Total events | 224 | 285 | 565 | 565 |
| NULL dates | 134 (60%) | 197 (69%) | 189 (33%) | **151 (27%)** |
| With dates | 90 | 88 | 376 | **414** |

Hit "Run Scraper" to pick up Abuela's Follies and other TIC-only Now Playing shows that the strategy agent will now add as new events with dates from detail pages.

## 2026-08-14_13-37-42 (session ddbeaf17)

**assistant**: Good data. 59 plays seeded, 0% event linkage, scraper doesn't extract playwright info at all. Let me produce the full documentation package.
