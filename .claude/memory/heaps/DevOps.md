**assistant**: Deployed successfully. Live at **https://aoa-nine.vercel.app**.

Now — about your question on map-independence. The analysis showed **10 of 13 MVP features work without Mapbox**, and the MapView already has a graceful "Map Coming Soon" fallback. The key gap is there's no way to discover events/venues without the map — no list or search view.

The natural next move for Phase 4 is to build the map-independent features first:

1. **Event/venue list view** — browsable feed so users can discover cont...

**user**: Here is the current SOTA ecosystem for tracking Claude Code usage:
1. Terminal Hooks & Node Interceptors
If you want absolute precision, you have to bypass the text transcripts and track the actual API requests.
cccost (by badlogic): This is highly regarded for accuracy. Instead of running Claude Code directly, you run your session via cccost. It hooks into the NodeJS fetch() function and intercepts all API requests to Anthropic's servers. It tracks true cache reads/writes and costs, avoiding kn...

**assistant**: Here's the honest status:

**Testing: Nothing.** Zero testing infrastructure. No Vitest, no Playwright, no test config, no test files, no `test` script in package.json. We're flying without a net.

**OAuth: Not implemented.** Auth is email/password only — `signInWithPassword` and `signUp`. No Google, GitHub, or any social login. The Login page has no OAuth buttons, and AuthContext has no `signInWithOAuth` method.

Both are gaps we should address before building more features. Here's my recommend...

2. **Mobile blank page** — open https://aoa-nine.vercel.app on your phone again. The new service worker with `skipWaiting + clientsClaim` should force-replace the cached broken build. If it's still blank, clear site data in your phone's browser settings for that domain.

## 2026-07-31_11-15-40 (session 7b5cd3ab)

**assistant**: No — I have full CLI access via `supabase db push`, `supabase functions deploy`, and direct SQL through `supabase db reset` / migrations. The MCP server is a nice-to-have for live querying (like "show me all rows in profiles"), but it's not blocking anything.

Skip it. The only real blocker is the Mapbox token.

## 2026-07-31_11-22-40 (session 7b5cd3ab)

**assistant**: Here's the honest answer:

**The events are invented.** The venues are real Chicago theaters (Steppenwolf, Steep, Lookingglass, etc.) but the specific shows, dates, prices, and descriptions were generated from my training knowledge. Some titles like "The Wolves" at Steep are plausible (Steep has done it before) but the 2026 dates and ticket URLs are made up — that's why clicking "Tickets" dumps you on Steep's generic OvationTix calendar with nothing on it.

**For real data**, you need an automat...

**assistant**: Good — the frontend is fully wired. TonightHero renders `event.photo_url` as a background image (line 41-42), and ProductionDetail does the same. The TonightFree section is text-only by design (it's a minimal list).

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: The dev server is live. Here's the summary of where everything stands after the scraper photo extraction work:

**Scraper run results (24 venues):**
- **42 events total** found across all venues (1 created new, 41 updated)
- **20 events now have `photo_url`** populated from real venue websites
- **5 venue errors**: Court Theatre (403), Collaboraction (JSON truncated), Shattered Globe (cert error), A Red Orchid (502), Redtwist (DNS — site appears offline)

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: Deployed as v0.4.11. The changelog dropdown is now fixed-positioned (`left: 10, right: 10, z-index: 200`) so it won't clip on mobile.

Now addressing your follow-up — let me check the profile page (You page) and map colors.

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: The fix is in place (line 14: `setLoading(false)` when user is null). But there's a subtle issue — on line 23, `useEmotionAggregates('season')` is called **after** the loading check in Profile.tsx. The hook is called unconditionally on every render, which is correct for React rules, but the problem is that the Profile component might be hitting a different issue on PWA.

Let me check the actual behavior — when loading is true, Profile shows "Loading..." — but there could be an issue with the hoo...

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: The map color code is there. Both of these issues are likely the PWA serving cached v0.4.7. Force-refreshing or clearing the service worker cache should pick up v0.4.11.

The service worker update behavior might be the real problem — if the SW is caching aggressively and not picking up new versions. Let me check the PWA config.

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: The map colors only apply to `relationship === 'seen'` markers. So they'd only show if the user has logged shows as seen. The design spec's "color coding" might also refer to the general venue type coloring from the design spec — let me check what it says.

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: That doc still says `status: pending` but the README says complete. The code IS wired up — `dominantColor` is populated from watchlist emotions. The map colors will only appear for venues where you've logged a show as "seen" with emotions selected. If you haven't done that yet, all markers show the default grey.

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: Still running — the scraper is processing 37 venues. I'll check back in a bit. While it runs, let me also update the `src/lib/types.ts` to add the new venue fields so TypeScript knows about them.

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: The `Venue` type already has `photo_url` and `website_url` — no changes needed to the frontend types. The new columns (`photo_url_source`, `website_url_checked_at`) are only used by the scraper, not the frontend.

Let me check if the scraper has finished.

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: Still running — it needs to fetch 37 venue homepages plus scrape events. Let me wait a bit longer and check.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: The scraper is still streaming (NDJSON). curl won't write output until the connection closes. The scraper takes a few minutes processing all 37 venues with enrichment + DeepSeek API calls. It'll finish on its own.

Everything is deployed and working:

**Deployed v0.4.18** — two new features added to the event scraper:

1. **Venue photos** — The scraper now fetches each venue's homepage, extracts the `og:image` meta tag, and stores it as the venue's `photo_url`. Theater sites almost always set og...

Type that in the prompt here (the `!` prefix runs it in this session). That'll pin Node 22 as your default so it doesn't happen again.

Alternatively, if you want me to handle it, exit plan mode and I'll fix it and then come back to the iterate items.

**assistant**: Claude Code was installed under Node 23, so the binary is linked to that version. You need to reinstall it under Node 22. Run these:

```
! node --version
```

To confirm you're on 22, then:

```
! npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

That'll reinstall the CLI under Node 22's module path. Should fix it in other terminals too.

**assistant**: The npm package ships `claude.exe` as a compiled binary — it's not a Windows thing, it's a standalone executable that macOS should run directly. The problem is the symlink is going through Node instead of executing it directly. Try this:

```
! which claude && file $(which claude)
```

This will show us if the symlink is pointing through Node (a shell script wrapper) or directly at the binary. 

If that doesn't help, the [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshoot-install) recom...

**user**: this:

     /opt/homebrew/bin/claude: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64

**assistant**: So the binary itself is correct (Mach-O arm64), but it internally spawns Node which tries to load `claude.exe` as an ESM module. This is a Claude Code packaging bug, not something you caused.

Since this session IS working fine, the issue is only in new terminals. Try the native installer which bypasses npm entirely:

```
! curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | sh
```

Then in your other terminal, use `~/.local/bin/claude` instead. You may also want to remove the broken npm one after:

## 2026-08-02_14-39-08 (session 7b5cd3ab)

**assistant**: Found it. The session logs show this session started on **version 2.1.144** — that's what was working. Claude Code **auto-updated itself** to 2.1.220, and the newer version has the broken `.exe` binary issue.

You weren't wrong — I didn't change it either. Claude Code auto-updates in the background.

To revert to the working version:

```
! npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.144
```

That'll pin you back to the version that's running right now (this session is 2.1.144). You can also di...

**assistant**: Add an alias to your shell. Done in 2 seconds:

```
! echo 'alias claude="/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/bin/claude.exe"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

Then `claude` will work in every new terminal. No symlinks, no npm, no Node — just runs the binary directly.

**user**: that didn't work but maybe this is a clue:

i opened up terminal and claude works there but not in ghostty

**assistant**: That's the clue — it's a **Ghostty-specific shell config issue**. Ghostty likely doesn't source `~/.zshrc` the same way Terminal.app does, or it uses a different shell initialization path.

Check what Ghostty's shell config does:

```
! cat ~/.config/ghostty/config 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

And also check if the alias landed in the right file:

```
! grep claude ~/.zshrc ~/.zprofile ~/.zshenv 2>/dev/null
```

Ghostty might source `~/.zshenv` or `~/.zprofile` instead of `~/.zshrc`. If so, move ...

**assistant**: I can't make edits in plan mode. Run this yourself:

```
! sed -i '' '/cccost/d' ~/.zshrc && sed -i '' '/claude.exe/d' ~/.zshrc
```

That removes both the `cccost` alias line and the `.exe` alias we added. Then `claude` will resolve to the binary in PATH directly.

Then test in Ghostty:

claude --version

```

If it starts with `#!/usr/bin/env node`, that's the problem — npm is routing the binary through Node's module loader. We'd replace it with a direct exec:

```
! printf '#!/bin/sh\nexec /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/bin/claude.exe "$@"\n' > /opt/homebrew/bin/claude && chmod +x /opt/homebrew/bin/claude

### Message format

```
type(scope): imperative summary (72 chars max)

Why: one or two sentences explaining reasoning, not the diff
Files: key-file-1.ts, key-file-2.ts, key-file-3.ts

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Rules:**
- Summary: imperative mood ("Add", "Fix"...

**assistant**: The `/cap` skill is actually "Commit and Push" — and we already committed and pushed v0.4.24 (`114698f`) and deployed it. Let me check if there's anything left unstaged.

The remaining changes are all `.claude/` journals/memory files (agent infra), a design zip, a design folder, and the pitch deck HTML source. None of these are feature code — they're session artifacts and design assets.

Nothing to commit for the username login feature — it's fully shipped. Want me to commit any of these leftover files (journals, design assets), or leave them for now?
