**assistant**: Note: .mcp.json is gitignored (it contains secrets), so it won't be committed — that's correct.

**user**: This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   Deric is building "The Art of Art" (AOA) — a map-centric PWA that guides newcomers into the Chicago theater scene through an AI mentor, martial-arts-belt progression, Goodreads-style tracking, and community reviews. 

   This session continued executing Graph Phases 0-3 from the build graph spec. Phase ...

**assistant**: **Phase 4: Content + Social** — all the map-independent features that make the app actually useful without a Mapbox token. The DB schemas are already built, so this is all UI + seed data.

Here's the natural order:

| # | Feature | What it delivers | Effort |
|---|---------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | **Event/venue list view** | Browse & discover without the map (fills the gap you flagged) | Medium |
| 2 | **Watchlist UI** | "Want to See" / "Seen" tracking (Goodreads-style) | Medium |

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: Good — the frontend is fully wired. TonightHero renders `event.photo_url` as a background image (line 41-42), and ProductionDetail does the same. The TonightFree section is text-only by design (it's a minimal list).

Let me verify the build passes and check what the dev server shows.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: Build passes clean. Now let me start the dev server and check the Tonight page visually.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: Dev server is already running. Let me check what the Tonight page actually fetches from the database — specifically whether the hero event has a photo_url.

**Scraper run results (24 venues):**
- **42 events total** found across all venues (1 created new, 41 updated)
- **20 events now have `photo_url`** populated from real venue websites
- **5 venue errors**: Court Theatre (403), Collaboraction (JSON truncated), Shattered Globe (cert error), A Red Orchid (502), Redtwist (DNS — site appears offline)

**assistant**: Agent 1 (data pipeline) returned. Key findings:

- **#2 Scraper completeness**: No cast/performers field anywhere — not in schema, scraper, or types. But the design spec (README.md §3.3) calls for "THE COMPANY" section with headshots. Full gap.
- **#10 Show times**: `show_times` column exists and the scraper extracts it, but the UI never renders it. Data is there, just not displayed.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: Deployed as v0.4.11. The changelog dropdown is now fixed-positioned (`left: 10, right: 10, z-index: 200`) so it won't clip on mobile.

Now addressing your follow-up — let me check the profile page (You page) and map colors.

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: The fix is in place (line 14: `setLoading(false)` when user is null). But there's a subtle issue — on line 23, `useEmotionAggregates('season')` is called **after** the loading check in Profile.tsx. The hook is called unconditionally on every render, which is correct for React rules, but the problem is that the Profile component might be hitting a different issue on PWA.

Let me check the actual behavior — when loading is true, Profile shows "Loading..." — but there could be an issue with the hoo...

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: The map color code is there. Both of these issues are likely the PWA serving cached v0.4.7. Force-refreshing or clearing the service worker cache should pick up v0.4.11.

The service worker update behavior might be the real problem — if the SW is caching aggressively and not picking up new versions. Let me check the PWA config.

## 2026-08-01_14-41-27 (session 7b5cd3ab)

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: The map colors only apply to `relationship === 'seen'` markers. So they'd only show if the user has logged shows as seen. The design spec's "color coding" might also refer to the general venue type coloring from the design spec — let me check what it says.

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: That doc still says `status: pending` but the README says complete. The code IS wired up — `dominantColor` is populated from watchlist emotions. The map colors will only appear for venues where you've logged a show as "seen" with emotions selected. If you haven't done that yet, all markers show the default grey.

Let me build and deploy the Profile fix now.

## 2026-08-03_16-52-53 (session 7b5cd3ab)

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: Found the issue. The Supabase client has no explicit auth persistence config, and the `onAuthStateChange` doesn't differentiate between events. If a token refresh fails (common after closing a PWA on mobile), the user gets silently signed out. Let me fix this.

**assistant**: [tool: Edit]

**assistant**: Now fix the AuthContext to handle token refresh failures gracefully — if a refresh fails, retry before giving up, and log events so we can diagnose further.

**assistant**: [tool: Bash]

**assistant**: **v0.4.23 deployed.** Three changes to fix session persistence:

1. **Explicit auth config** — `persistSession: true`, `autoRefreshToken: true`, and `flowType: 'pkce'`. These were implicit defaults before, but the PKCE flow is more robust for PWAs than the default implicit flow because it handles token exchange more reliably after the app has been closed and reopened.

2. **Mounted guard** — prevents stale async callbacks from updating auth state after the component unmounts (a race condition du...
